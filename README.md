# Programming Course — static site

Simple multi-page static website. Files added:

- `index.html` — homepage with 4 cards (HTML, CSS, JS, Python)
- `python.html` — 20 concept flip-cards with examples
- `html.html`, `css.html`, `js.html` — placeholders
- `assets/css/style.css` — styles
- `assets/js/main.js` — flip behaviour and small enhancements

How to use:

Open `index.html` in your browser. On Windows you can double-click it or run:

```pwsh
Start-Process index.html
```

Accessibility:

- Flip cards are keyboard-focusable and can be flipped with Enter/Space.
- Uses readable contrast and large touch targets.

Next steps you might want:

- Fill the other topic pages with 20 concepts each (like Python page).
- Add images/icons and better responsive typography.
- Bundle as a small SPA if you want transitions between pages.
